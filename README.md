========

Scripts in PHP about math subjects. Some math problems lend themselves quite easily
to a solution in a general-purpose scripting language such as PHP.

For other math problems, you are better off with specialized tools.

One tool that I extensively explored in 2013 is the computer algebra system [maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net).
I wrote quite a few scripts for it, in response to questions on the Google+ Mathematics community, and I published
them there, if you are interested.

I have always thought that Social Media are not that particularly useful for any specific purpose.
When on top of being almost useless, someone tried to impersonate me, I closed the door on Google+. Here he is:

I think that Facebook and Google+ are even dangerous.

If anything of financial value ever starts going on there -- as opposed to just aimless babbling -- you will soon
no longer be talking to the person that you think you are talking with at Google+ or Facebook,
but more likely to his murderer, who has successfully taken his place, and is now controlling
his social media accounts.

Stealing passwords is excessively easy, especially from people who use Windows or from people who use 
typical consumer-oriented routers that generally have backdoors. You can find a few of these backdoors here:

Facebook and Google+ dangerously give the impression that you are talking to the person that you think you are.
Especially the images (avatars) are very misleading. The accumulation of history also gives false credibility.
None of this will help, if the attacker manages to get control of the account. He will start leading your life
in your stead. Since you are at that point just an annoyance and could disturb your attacker, it would be more
convenient that you disappear.

I no longer use Social Media that insist on real names and encourage you to spread around pictures of yourself.
Throw a bank account with money into the fray, and half of the members of the community will sooner or later end up
with their dead bodies concealed in concrete somewhere in a nearby construction site.
